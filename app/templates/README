Organization
* errors - Error pages
* injects - Things that are used regularly like the leaderboard, should be pulled out and placed in their own template which can be injected, these are stored here
* pages - The main pages
* design - pieces used everywhere for design perposes, like the site template

If you have a better way that makes more sense, I am all ears.

If you don't know where to look, try to start with pages
